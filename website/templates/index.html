	<h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>JuxtaposeJS helps storytellers compare two pieces of similar media, including photos, and GIFs. It&rsquo;s ideal for highlighting then/now stories that explain slow changes over time (growth of a city skyline, regrowth of a forest, etc.) or before/after stories that show the impact of single dramatic events (natural disasters, protests, wars, etc.).</p>
	<p>It is free, easy to use, and works on all devices. All you need to get started are links to the images you'd like to compare.</p>
